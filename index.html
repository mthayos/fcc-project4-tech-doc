                <p>A tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. The art of making tattoos is tattooing.</p>

                <p>Tattoos generally fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); and pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). In addition, tattoos can be used for identification such as ear tattoos on livestock as a form of branding.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The word tattoo, or tattow in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Samoan word tatau, meaning "to strike". The Oxford English Dictionary gives the etymology of tattoo as "In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu." Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring or staining.</p>

                <p>Tattoos date back many thousands of years. In fact, there is firm evidence that tattooing is an ancient art form, after discoveries of tattoos on mummified skin were found. The oldest evidence of human tattoos is believed to be from between 3370 BC and 3100 BC.</p>

                <p>Hand poking with a simple sterile needle and ink will always be the most direct and traditional way of making a tattoo. However, there are many types of modern tattoo machines that are more commonly used today.</p>

                <p>Types of Modern Tattoo Machines/Methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Hand Poke:</b> aka "Stick n' Poke" is a non-electric method that's done freestyle with needle and ink</li>
                        <li><b>Rotary Tattoo Machine:</b> A exenter-rotary tattoo machine, invented in 1978 by Manfred Kohrs of Germany. Rotary tattoo machines were the original machines, based on rotary technology, which was invented by Samuel O'Reilly and improved by the tattoo artists through the years. Rotary type machines use an electric motor to drive the needles.</li>
                        <li><b>Coil Tattoo Machine:</b> Coil tattoo machines are the most commonly seen and used. These machines use an electromagnetic circuit to move the needle grouping.</li>
                        <li><b></b>Pneumatic Tattoo Machine:</b> A pneumatic tattoo machine is powered by an air compressor and is extremely lightweight. Pneumatic tattoo machines use pressurized air to drive the needles up and down.</li>
                        <li><b>Liner Tattoo Machine:</b> The purpose of a liner machine is to lay the ink in the skin in one single pass to create a dominant line. It uses a short contact circuit (about 1.5mm–2mm), which causes the machine to cycle faster.</li>
                        <li><b>Shader Tattoo Machine:</b> The shader machine is commonly used to shade black or variants of black ink. Also colors other than black are used in this type of machine. The saturation level of this machine is low. It uses a bigger contact gap than a liner (about 2mm–3.5mm) to make it cycle slightly slower. This machine is also used for sculpting lines. Some artists will use this type of machine for all lines, as it allows the lines to be retraced with less trauma to the skin</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="tat-quote"><code>“And this tattooing, had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth...”<br> ― Herman Melville</code></div>

                <p>When it comes to selecting the right style for a brand new tattoo, it is important to know correct tattoo terminology. Knowing the different styles of tattoo will help  client better communicate with the tattoo artist.</p>

                <p>Types of Tattoo:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Traditional Style:</b> also called Old School, American Traditional, Classic Tattoo or Western Traditional, is known for its bold lines, bright colors, and iconic designs like roses, anchors, and gorgeous lady heads. With heavy hitters in the history of Traditional like Sailor Jerry, Don Ed Hardy, Bert Grimm, and Lyle Tuttle, this style of tattooing is one of the most well-known and beloved aesthetics within the tattoo community.</li>
                        <li><b>Realism:</b> also called Realistic Tattoo or Phot-Realism Tattoo is based on classical realism which has been a part of fine art since as far back as the Renaissance. It only found its way to the world of tattoos recently, cropping up around the latter half of the 20th century.</li>
                        <li><b>Watercolor:</b> The watercolor style looks like what it sounds like, as if rendered with a brush dabbled in watery pastels. </li>
                        <li><b>Tribal:</b> Tribal tattoos — i.e. indigenous body art — are the oldest in the world, dating back thousands of years. This style should actually be thought of as multiple styles or more so different traditions of tattooing from aboriginal communities all around the globe. </li>
                        <li><b>New School:</b> aka Neo-Traditional features the core properties of its predecessor, like pronounced linework and extremely vibrant colors but it also has an illustrative quality to it. This is because Neo traditional artists are highly influenced by Art Nouveau and Art Deco aesthetics. The main difference between traditional tattoos and neo traditional tattoos is that neo traditional tattoos often have a broader color palette and a broader range of motifs. Pieces done in this style are known for their lush, decorative details as well as the use of natural imagery such as florals and animals.</li>
                        <li><b>Blackwork:</b> Stylistically speaking, blackwork is a very broad categorical term. It applies almost any body art that's created using solely black ink, but as you can imagine, a lot can be done with this versatile and striking color. Looking through blackwork artists portfolios, you'll see all kinds of tattoo types from ancient sacred geometry to modern abstract ornamental designs to extremely detailed illustrative pieces.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Because it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.</p>

                <div class="tat-quote"><code>“If the body is a temple, then tattoos are its stained glass windows.”<br> ― Sylvia Plath</code></div>

                <p>In amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, there is an elevated risk of infection. Infections that can theoretically be transmitted by the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink include surface infections of the skin, fungal infections, some forms of hepatitis, herpes simplex virus, HIV, staph, tetanus, and tuberculosis.</p>

                <p>When considering getting a tattoo please be informed of your state and local regulations regarding health and liscensing of the tattoo industry. Only get tattooed in a liscensed studio by a qualified tattoo artist.</p>
